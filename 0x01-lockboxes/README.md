# 0x01. Lockboxes
**Algorithm Python**

This project contains python interview coding challenges.

## Must Know
For this project, you will need a solid understanding of several key concepts in order to develop a solution that can efficiently determine if all boxes can be opened. Hereâ€™s a list of concepts and resources that will be instrumental in tackling this project:

### Concepts Needed:
#### 1\. Lists and List Manipulation:

* Understanding how to work with lists, including accessing elements, iterating over lists, and modifying lists dynamically.
* [Python Lists (Python Official Documentation)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html "Python Lists (Python Official Documentation)")
#### 2\. Graph Theory Basics:

* Although not explicitly required, knowledge of graph theory (especially concepts related to traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search) can be very helpful in solving this problem, as the boxes and keys can be thought of as nodes and edges in a graph.
* [Graph Theory (Khan Academy)](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/graph-representation/a/representing-graphs "Graph Theory (Khan Academy")
#### 3\. Algorithmic Complexity:

* Understanding the time and space complexity of your solution is important, as it can help in writing more efficient algorithms.
* [Big O Notation (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/asymptotic-notation-and-analysis-based-on-input-size-of-algorithms/ "Big O Notation (GeeksforGeeks)")
#### 4\. Recursion:

* Some solutions might require a recursive approach to traverse through the boxes and keys.
* [Recursion in Python (Real Python)](https://realpython.com/python-recursion/ "Recursion in Python (Real Python)")
#### 5\. Queue and Stack:

* Knowing how to use queues and stacks is crucial if implementing a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse through the keys and boxes.
* [Python Queue and Stack (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue-in-python/ "Python Queue and Stack (GeeksforGeeks)")
#### 6\. Set Operations:

* Understanding how to use sets for keeping track of visited boxes and available keys can optimize the search process.
* [Python Sets (Python Official Documentation)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets "Python Sets (Python Official Documentation)")

By reviewing these concepts and utilizing these resources, you will be well-equipped to develop an efficient solution for this project, applying both your algorithmic thinking and Python programming skills.

## Requirements
**General**
* Allowed editors: `vi, vim, emacs`
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS` using `python3 (version 3.4.3)`
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should be documented
* Your code should use the `PEP 8` style (`version 1.7.x`)
* All your files must be executable

## Tasks

+ [x] 0. **Lockboxes**<br/>[0-lockboxes.py](0-lockboxes.py) contains a script that meets the following requirements:
  + You have `n` number of locked boxes in front of you. Each box is numbered sequentially from `0` to `n - 1` and each box may contain keys to the other boxes.
  + Write a method that determines if all the boxes can be opened.
    + Prototype: `def canUnlockAll(boxes)`.
    + `boxes` is a list of lists.
    + A key with the same number as a box opens that box.
    + You can assume all keys will be positive integers.
      + There can be keys that do not have boxes.
    + The first box `boxes[0]` is unlocked.
    + Return `True` if all boxes can be opened, else return `False`.
